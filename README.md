# ☕ Coffee Talk

**Coffee Talk** is a friendly Slack bot that helps teams share thoughts, half-baked ideas, and rubber duck debugging in personal, thread-only channels. It creates a cozy, async space for thinking out loud—without adding noise to public conversations.

---

## 🌟 What It Does

- Creates personal, public channels like `#coffeetalk_jane`
- Enforces posting rules:
  - Only the channel owner can post top-level messages
  - Everyone else replies in threads
- Welcomes new users and offers them a chance to create their own Coffee Talk channel
- Offers helpful slash commands:
  - `/coffeetalk-help` – Show an explainer
  - `/coffeetalk-create` – Create your own channel
  - `/ping-coffeetalk` – Check if the bot is running

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Node.js + [@slack/bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt-js)
- Socket Mode for real-time interactivity
- Express (for health checks)
- Hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) or any Node-compatible environment

## Required Scopes

Make sure your app has the following **bot token scopes**:

```
channels:read
channels:write
channels:manage
channels:history
chat:write
chat:write.public
commands
users:read
```

And in your `manifest.yml`, enable:

```yaml
settings:
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - message.channels
      - team_join
```

## Example

A `#coffeetalk_maria` channel looks like this:

* Maria can post top-level updates.
* Teammates can reply in threads.
* Coffee Bot enforces this politely and automatically.

---

## 💡 Ideas for Future Features

* Scheduled prompts (e.g. “What are you working on today?”)
* Journaling mode (private + exportable)
* Weekly thread digests
* Optional emoji reactions tracking
